This task comes from [OpanujJS](https://przeprogramowani.pl/kurs-javascript).

## Short description

## How to use it?

The following instructions will allow you to work with thids project. Remember that I use [this](https://github.com/mb-dir/webpack_basic_template) webpack boilerplate.

### Prerequisites

- node
- npm
- git(or other DVCS)

### Installing
- Open your termilan in folder where you want to copy the project
- Paste ` git clone https://github.com/mb-dir/Nawyki.git .`
- Use `npm instal` in order to install all required resources

### Scripts
- ` npm run dev ` - runs development mode(with devserver),
- ` npm run prod  ` - runs production mode,
- ` npm run publish  ` - runs prod config and publish the page using gh-pages branch

These scripts comes from [there](https://github.com/mb-dir/webpack_basic_template)

## My comments
- At the moment I am satisfied with the overall structure of the project, it seems to me that the files are properly separated and there is no clutter in the code
- In my opinion the visual layer of the application is sufficient. The entire layout is simple and intuitive
- It seems to me that the story in the git is not quite correctly structured. I tried to assume "one change, one commit", and in fact I don't think there were several unrelated changes in a single commit, but I could definitely use the potential of the tags in a better way - tags should be a kind of marking the end of implementing some changes, this project lacked this. In addition, at some point, the story begins to diverge strangely, I have no idea what it comes from, or I just don't remember it

Overall I am happy with this project, it seems to me that it is the best project in terms of code (as I mentioned from git history I am not happy) that I have written so far
